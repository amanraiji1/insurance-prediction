# Insurance Prediction

This project focuses on predicting insurance-related outcomes using machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to build a robust machine learning model.

---

## Overview

Insurance companies often rely on predictive models to estimate outcomes such as claim amounts or customer risk profiles. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that effectively predicts target variables based on the provided dataset.

## Features of the Notebook

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   - Loads and inspects the dataset to understand its structure and features.  
   - Identifies missing values and potential outliers.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encodes categorical variables.  
   - Normalizes numerical features.  
   - Handles missing data and prepares the dataset for modeling.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzes feature distributions and correlations.  
   - Visualizes key trends and insights.  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Implements machine learning models such as:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Trees  
     - Random Forest  
     - Gradient Boosting  
   - Compares model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Validates the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.  
   - Visualizes results through confusion matrices and feature importance.
